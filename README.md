# Home-Security-Robot
Made as part of my Computing BSc Undergrad degree at the University of Portsmouth

This project was originally intended to be open-source and free to use, but I had to wait until I got my grade, so now that I have graduated, I have released the code free to use.

The code used in this project should not be used as a guideline for writing good code. Many of the aspects of this project are things that I had never used before.

The code I used for the esp32cam won't be included, you can get that from this repository https://github.com/rzeldent/esp32cam-rtsp. This upload is only for the Flutter app that connects to the esp32cam and the Arduino Nano driving code.

When I last built the app, I had issues connecting to the IP address of the esp32cam, but I got it working with the debug build. Is there an issue with the actual build that the debug build somehow solves? Feel free to send a push request if you know why this is happening.

(I may have a video of the development process coming.)
