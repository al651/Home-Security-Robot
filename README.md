# Home-Security-Robot
Made as part of my Computing BsC at Portsmouth University

This project was originally intended to be open-source and free to use, but I had to wait until I got my grade, so now that I have graduated, I have released the code free to use.

The code used in this project should not be used as a guideline for writing good code. Many of the aspects of this project are things that I had never used before.

(I may have a video of the development process coming.)
